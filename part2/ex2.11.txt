I am developing a containerized application that will run on HY OpenShift platform.
It would be easiest to also have the development happen inside the same containers that will be used in production.

The app uses both a Redis cache and a MongoDB server. These are now spun up in docker-composer along with the app itself. Now I don't have to install these server applications locally!
